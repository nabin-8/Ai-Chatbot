### Implementing a Chatbot

##### Introduction
 - A chatbot is an artificial intelligence that simulates a conversation with a user through apps or messaging.

 - Chatbots are the future of AI, as they provide the closest to a natural conversation between humans and machines. Chatbots are not new to us; the first chatbot was Eliza, but it was not as complex as the chatbots we have nowadays, such as Siri or Alexa.

 ##### Principles
 1. Type
    - what type of chatbot you want to implement: rule-based, self-learning, or a mixture of the two
    - Self-learning chatbots use ML and AI techniques and algorithms to save the inputs from the user and use them later.
    - Rule-based chatbots have predefined rules that they follow.

 1. Target audience
    - You must know the target audience for which you are making our chatbot. you cannot have a universal chatbot that can answer all questions related to a variety of possible problems.

 1. Natural language
    - You should also keep in mind the natural language of communication for the chatbot. you will choose the natural language after you have decided on the target audience.

 1. Responses
    - You also need to provide appropriate responses for initial questions to the chatbot.

##### Features
- In this activity, we will be using a Python library, chatterbot, to implement a chatbot.

- This library generates automated responses to the user input. The responses are based on machine learning algorithms implemented in the library.

- Our goal is to make sure that the chatbot is trained in multiple languages in order to cater to different communities.

- The ML algorithms make it easier for the chatbot to improve and evolve its responses over time as it collects user responses.
